`bmm` (stands for "bookmarks manager") lets you get to your bookmarks in a
flash.

![tui-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3dc5fb7-d258-461e-86b5-f2498dfbd4dc)

It does so by storing your bookmarks locally, allowing you to quickly access,
manage, and search through them using various commands. `bmm` has a traditional
command line interface that can be used standalone or integrated with other
tools, and a textual user interface for easy browsing.

ü§î Motivation
---

I'd been using [buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku) for managing my bookmarks
via the command line. It's a fantastic tool, but I was noticing some slowdown
after years of collecting bookmarks in it. I was curious if I could replicate
the subset of its functionality that I used while improving search performance.
Additionally, I missed having a TUI to browse bookmarks in. `bmm` started out as
a way to fulfill both goals. Turns out, it runs quite a lot faster than `buku`
(check out benchmarks
[here](https://github.com/dhth/bmm/actions/workflows/bench.yml)). I've now moved
my bookmark management completely to `bmm`, but `buku` remains an excellent
tool, and those looking for a broader feature set should definitely check it
out.

‚å® CLI mode
---

`bmm` allows every action it supports to be performed via its CLI. As such, it
can be easily integrated with other search tools (eg.
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf),
etc.)

üìü TUI mode
---

To allow for quick access, `bmm` ships with its own TUI. The TUI simplifies
browsing with a user-friendly interface. It can be launched either in a generic
mode (via `bmm tui`) or in the context of a specific command (e.g., `bmm search
tools --tui`).
