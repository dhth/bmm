bmm (stands for "bookmarks manager") lets you get to your bookmarks in a flash.

It does so by storing your bookmarks locally, allowing you to quickly access,
manage, and search through them using various commands.

bmm has a traditional command line interface that can be used standalone or
integrated with other tools, and a textual user interface for easy browsing.
